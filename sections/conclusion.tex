\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Mutation testing while well-recognized as a way to test the quality of a test suite is too costly
to use practically use. Therefore, various techniques have been established to reduce the costs
of performing mutation analysis. Performing these reduction techniques has required researches
to incorporate a method into an existing mutation testing system. \mr is a tool that enables
the study of reduction techniques in a more cost-effective way, retrospectively. By retrospectively
analysing the data collected from prior analysis of all mutants, the \mr tool is able to reduce
the upfront costs and obviate the need to understand the domain complexities associated with implementing an approach
into a mutation testing system. In addition to
being introduced in this paper and following economic and social phenomenon of open-source software~\cite{hippel2003open}, \mr
has been released under an open-source license to the public on GitHub~\cite{github}.

In future work, we plan to extend the functionality of \mr by integrating additional
mutant reduction techniques. By integrating more techniques, the \mr tool will allow
for a more comprehensive study of superiority in terms of effectiveness amongst existing
mutant reduction techniques. Furthermore, \mr will provide an easy-to-use and rapid
way to test the effectiveness of neoteric reduction approaches.
