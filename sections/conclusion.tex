\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

Mutation testing while well-recognized as a way to test the quality of a test suite is too costly
to use practically use. Therefore, various techniques have been established to reduce the cost.
Performing these reduction techniques in the past has required researches
to incorporate a reduction method into a mutation testing system. \mr alleviates the burden of implementing
each approach by analysing reduction techniques in a more cost-effective way, retrospectively.
By retrospectively analysing the data collected from prior analysis of all mutants, the \mr tool is able to reduce
the upfront costs and obviate the need to understand the domain complexities associated with implementing an approach
into a mutation testing system. In addition to
being introduced in this paper and following economic and social phenomenon of open-source software~\cite{hippel2003open}, \mr
has been released under an open-source license to the public on GitHub~\cite{github}.

In future work, we plan to extend the functionality of \mr by integrating additional
mutant reduction techniques allowing
for a more comprehensive study of superiority in terms of efficiency and effectiveness amongst
mutant reduction techniques. Furthermore, \mr will provide an easy-to-use and rapid
way to test the efficiency and effectiveness of neoteric reduction approaches.
