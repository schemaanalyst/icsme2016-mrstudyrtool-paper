% Re-introduce the challenges of mutation testing and summarize what this tool provides

Although mutation testing is well-recognized as a way to assess test suite quality, it may be too costly to practically
use. As such, various methods have been developed to decrease the cost of mutation testing. Performing these reduction
techniques in the past has required researchers and experimenters to incorporate a reduction method into an, often
complex, mutation testing tool. \mr~alleviates the burden of implementing each approach by retrospectively analysing
reduction techniques, a potentially more cost-effective method.

% TODO: It would be ideal if this paragraph could point out the experimental results in this paper

% Summarize some of the key features of the tool and then talk about how it is released and enables future work

By retrospectively analysing the data collected from prior analysis of all mutants, the \mr~tool is able to reduce the
upfront human-implementation costs and obviate the need for researchers and industrialists to understand the domain
complexities associated with understanding a mutation testing system. Furthermore, \mr~provides an
easy-to-use and rapid way to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of mutant reduction methods. In addition to being
detailed in this paper, \mr~has been released under an open-source license on a GitHub site that features extensive
documentation and a screencast~\cite{tool}. In future work, we plan to extend the functionality of \mr~by integrating
additional mutant reduction techniques, thereby allowing for a more comprehensive comparison of the techniques'
efficiency and effectiveness.
