\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

Although mutation testing is well-recognized as a way to assess test suite
quality, is often too costly to practically use. As such, various techniques
have been developed to reduce the cost of mutation testing. Performing these
reduction techniques in the past has required researchers and experimenters to
incorporate a reduction method into an, often complex, mutation testing tool.
\mr~alleviates the burden of implementing each approach by retrospectively
analysing reduction techniques, a potentially more cost-effective way.

By retrospectively analysing the data collected from prior analysis of all
mutants, the \mr~tool is able to reduce the upfront costs and obviate the need
for researchers and industrialists to understand the domain complexities
associated with implementing an approach into a mutation testing system.
Furthermore, \mr~provides an easy-to-use and rapid way to assess the efficiency
and effectiveness of mutant reduction methods. In addition to being detailed in
this paper, \mr~has been released under an open-source license on a GitHub site
that features extensive documentation and a screencast~\cite{tool}. In future
work, we plan to extend the functionality of \mr~by integrating additional
mutant reduction techniques, thereby allowing for a more comprehensive
comparison of the techniques' efficiency and effectiveness.
