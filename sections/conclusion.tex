\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

Mutation testing while well-recognized as a way to determine test suite quality, is too costly
to practically use. Therefore, various techniques have been established to reduce the cost
of mutation testing. Performing these reduction techniques in the past has required researchers
and experimenters to incorporate a reduction method into a mutation testing system. \mr~alleviates
the burden of implementing each approach by analysing reduction techniques in a more cost-effective
way, retrospectively.

By retrospectively analysing the data collected from prior analysis of all
mutants, the \mr~tool is able to reduce the upfront costs and obviate the need to understand the
domain complexities associated with implementing an approach into a mutation testing system.
Furthermore, \mr~provides an easy-to-use and rapid way to test the efficiency and effectiveness of
neoteric reduction approaches. In addition to being introduced in this paper and following economic
and social phenomenon of open-source software~\cite{hippel2003open}, \mr~has been released under an
open-source license to the public on GitHub~\cite{github}.

In future work, we plan to extend the functionality of \mr~by integrating additional
mutant reduction techniques; allowing for a more comprehensive comparison of the techniques'
efficiency and effectiveness.
