\section{Retrospective Analysis}

Performing mutation testing, displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:process}, is often considered to
be too expensive to take advantage of in industry. While reducing the number of mutants
using techniques such as mutant sampling improve efficiency, they do not reduce the cost
enough to make mutation testing affordable. Additionally, integrating the various methods
to reduce the number of mutants into a mutation testing system requires the programmer to
understand the intricacies of the testing tool. Furthermore, after integrating a reduction
technique into a testing tool, the major computational expense of performing mutation testing
is incurred. Then, finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of a reduction technique can be
assessed.

By analysing mutant reducing methods in retrospect, the efficiency and effectiveness
can be determined without understanding the intricacies of complex mutation testing tools
or having to integrate every technique a tool. The ``trial-and-error'' method~\cite{edwards2004using}
of evaluating reduction techniques is now performed on the data, eliminating the expenses and
complexities of integrating and testing every approach. Moreover, the minimal upfront costs
of retrospective analysis enable it to be utilized to provide more rapid feedback to a tester
regarding the effectiveness of reduction techniques. Heretofore, no tool existed that
was capable of analysing mutant reduction techniques retrospectively.
