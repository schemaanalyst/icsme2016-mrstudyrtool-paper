\subsection{Retrospective Analysis with \mr}

The next phase in the mutation analysis process is retrospective analysis. In this
phase, mutants statuses are determined. Where a mutant is considered
``dead'' if when executing the modified version of the source
code the output differed from the original version. Conversely, a mutant remains alive
if the output from the modified version of the source code does not differ.
More importantly, in this phase of the mutation analysis process,
the efficiency and effectiveness of various reduction techniques are evaluated.

To avoid the cost of performing mutation multiple times, \mr retrospectively studies
the efficiency and effectiveness of each reduction technique from the data collected from
prior analysis of all mutants.
