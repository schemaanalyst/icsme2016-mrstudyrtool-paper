  Mutation testing is a well-known method for measuring a test suite's quality.  However, due to its computational
  expense and intrinsic difficulties (e.g., detecting equivalent mutants and potentially checking a mutant's status for
  each test), mutation testing is often challenging to practically use. To control the computational cost of mutation
  testing, many reduction strategies have been proposed (e.g., uniform random sampling over mutants). Yet, a stand-alone
  tool to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of these methods is heretofore unavailable. Since existing mutation
  testing tools are often complex and language-dependent, this paper presents a tool, called \mr, that enables the
  ``retrospective'' study of mutant reduction methods using the data collected from a prior analysis of all mutants.
  Focusing on the mutation operators and the mutants that they produce, the presented tool allows developers to
  prototype and study mutant reducers without being burdened by the implementation details of mutation testing tools. In
  addition to describing \mr's design and overviewing the experimental results from using it, this paper inaugurates the
  public release of this open-source tool.
