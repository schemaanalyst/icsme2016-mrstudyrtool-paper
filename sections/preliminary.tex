\section{Preliminary Study}

\input{tables/schemas}

We chose these nine schemas because they range in triviality. For example, the MozillaPermissions schema contains a
single constraint, where as the JWhoisServer schema has a total of 50 constraints. This allowed us to evaluate the
policy recommendations made based on the effectiveness of reduction techniques analysed by \mr~for schemas of varying
complexities.
