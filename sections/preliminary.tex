\section{Preliminary Study}

\input{figures/graph}

% GMK NOTE: All of this content is really about the design of the experiments and thus it has to be integrated into this
% section (currently, this is still rough content).

To display the effectiveness and domain extensibility, we empirically analysed the nine schemas in Table~\ref{tbl:study-schemas}
with the presented tool.
% These schemas were chosen due to the range in triviality --- the total number of constraints ({\small$\sum$Constraints}).
Similar to Wong and Mathur in their studies~\cite{mathur1994empirical, wong1993mutation} \mr~performs mutant sampling with $x$ value intervals
larger than $1\%$.  Specifically, \mr~analyses $x$ at $1\%$ and  $10\%$, then increases by $10\%$ intervals to a max value of $90\%$.
By lowering the granularity of the experiment to $10\%$ intervals, \mr~reduces the cost of performing retrospective analysis, while observing
similar trends, displayed in Figure ~\ref{fig:graph}.

% CJM: to find the distance between original and reduced mutation scores
% this example below is just for an x value of 1 and for random sampling

% d <- read_data("sqlite-avmdefaults.dat")
% d <- select_empirical_study_schemas(d)
% d <- select_normal_data(d)
% t <- analyse(d)
% t_filt <- dplyr::filter(t, method == "random_sampling", percentage == 1)
% diff <- abs((t_filt$original_mutation_score - t_filt$reduced_mutation_score))
% max(diff)
% [1] 0.4666667

% CJM: to find the min and max RMSE at a given percentage
% this example below is just for an x value of 1 and for random sampling

% d <- read_data("sqlite-avmdefaults.dat")
% d <- select_empirical_study_schemas(d)
% d <- select_normal_data(d)
% t <- analyse(d)
% t_filt <- dplyr::filter(t, method == "random_sampling", percentage == 1)
% c <- analyse_calculations(t_filt)
% max(c$root_mean_squared_error)
% [1] 0.20367
% min(c$root_mean_squared_error)
% [1] 0.06175125

% CJM: to create the visualisation currently in the paper:

% d <- read_data("sqlite-avmdefaults.dat")
% d <- select_empirical_study_schemas(d)
% d <- select_normal_data(d)
% t <- analyse(d)
% pers <- c(1, 10, 20, 40)
% t_filt <- dplyr::filter(t, method == "random_sampling", percentage %in% pers)
% visualise_mutation_score_across_schemas(t_filt)

Figure~\ref{fig:graph} is a box-and-whisker plot with the analysed schemas on the horizontal-axis and the mutation scores of the reduced
sets after random sampling at the following $x$ values: 1\%, 10\%, 20\%, 40\%, on the vertical-axis, .
The $x$ values in Figure~\ref{fig:graph} were chosen in this range because reduced sets' mutation scores at these thresholds
drastically increase in accuracy --- approach the mutation score of the original set. Moving from top-left to bottom-right, the boxes in
Figure~\ref{fig:graph} show this increase in accuracy by becoming smaller as the maximum fractional threshold increases.

This increase in accuracy occurs because the mutation scores of reduced sets with smaller fractional thresholds are extremely volatile
and can vary largely based on one or few mutants, while the mutation scores of sets with higher fractional thresholds are substantially
more stable. In the top-left of Figure~\ref{fig:graph}, $x$ is evaluated at 1\%. In this quadrant of Figure~\ref{fig:graph}, sets' mutation
scores are as distant from the original mutation as $0.467$. Additionally, at this threshold, the ``lower-is-better'' metric,
RMSE, ranges from $0.062$ to $0.204$. Stability is demonstrated in mutation scores of sets with as small as a 10\% maximum fractional
threshold, with RMSE ranging from $0.013$ to $0.065$. At this same threshold, Wong and Mathur observed that mutation
scores of reduced sets were within $0.16$ of the original set's mutation score~\cite{mathur1994empirical, wong1993mutation}. Using \mr~to
retrospectively perform random sampling with an $x$ value of 10\%, we observed mutation scores of reduced sets to be within $0.13$ of the
original set's mutation score.

The trend of becoming more accurate as the maximum fractional threshold increases remains true for $x$ values of 20\% and 40\%. At the
thresholds of 20\% and 40\%, the mutation scores of reduced sets are within $0.083$ and $0.075$ of the original mutation scores,
respectively. It is acknowledged that the results experienced in the preliminary study of \mr~may be specific to the sample data used or
database schemas being the domain analysed.
