\subsection{Tool Usage}

% Explain how you have to store the data in the mrstudyr package

We designed the \mr~tool to make it simple to perform a thorough and automated empirical analysis of mutant reduction
techniques. The common structure of an R package expects that externally-collected data is stored in the
\texttt{inst/extdata} folder. This is the location where \mr~expects to find the mutation data, stored as a
comma-separated value file; in this paper, we ran the \sa~tool~\cite{McMinn2016} to generate the data used as input
to \mr.

% To display the results from \mr~performing mutant reduction strategies for the testing of real-world
% database schemas, the following commands will be tailored toward the data from performing mutation testing.

% Release as an R package makes installing and loading a tool easy, but does not guarantee usability.

% Explain how the first phrases of the presented tool will work, running the technique and accumulating data

The ``Reduction Techniques'', as referenced in Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}, are performed following the provision of
mutant data, the ``Original Data'', to \mr. Using \mr~to perform analyses and create visualisations requires the call of
a single function call per-technique; the functions are {\texttt{create\_random\_sampling\_graphs()}} and
{\texttt{create\_operator\_sampling\_graphs()}}. Both functions accumulate the reduced data over 30 trials into a single
data set, as shown by the ``Accumulated Reduced Data'' ellipse in Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}.  After performing a
reduction technique, it is evaluated in the ``Efficiency and Effectiveness Analysis'' phase that results in the output
of these values: mutation score (MS), cost reduction (Red.), correlation (Corr.), and error (Err.).

% Due to space constraints, did not discuss the difference between RMSE and MAE.

While mutation score and cost reduction are calculated in the function performing the analysis, Kendall's
\taub~correlation coefficient~\cite{mcminn2016virtual} and the chosen errors are calculated by
\texttt{analyse\_calculations()}, where the input is the accumulated reduced data from a reduction technique
and the output is a new data set with the values of the respective calculation.  The errors calculated by
\mr~are the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE), both ``lower-is-better'' metrics.
These error calculations were chosen due to their wide adoption to evaluate model performance~\cite{chai2014root}.
Demonstrating the usability of \mr~is the fact that it requires only two commands to perform the analysis and
calculate model evaluation. This same simplicity also remains true for the final phase, ``Human Examination''.

The human examination phase still requires use of \mr~to present the results of the efficiency and
effectiveness analysis. \mr~takes advantage of Hadley Wickham's widely-used graphing package,
\texttt{ggplot2}~\cite{ggplot2}, to create comprehensible visualisations, which will help researchers and
industrialists construct a policy recommendation regarding which reduction technique should be used for the
data under observation. The documentation, a screencast~\cite{asciinema}, and useful visualisations can be
found on \mr's GitHub page~\cite{tool}.
