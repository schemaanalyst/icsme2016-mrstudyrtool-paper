\subsection{Tool Usage}

\input{figures/mrstudyr}

% Explain how you have to store the data in the mrstudyr package

We designed the \mr~tool to make it simple to perform a thorough and automated empirical analysis of mutant reduction
techniques. The common structure of an R package expects that externally-collected data is stored in the
\texttt{inst/extdata} folder. This is the location where \mr~expects to find the mutation data, stored as a
comma-separated value file; in this paper, we ran the \sa~tool~\cite{McMinn2016} to generate the data used as input
to \mr.

% To display the results from \mr~performing mutant reduction strategies for the testing of real-world
% database schemas, the following commands will be tailored toward the data from performing mutation testing.

% Release as an R package makes installing and loading a tool easy, but does not guarantee usability.

% Explain how the first phrases of the presented tool will work, running the technique and accumulating data

The ``Reduction Techniques'', as referenced in Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}, are performed following the provision of
mutant data, the ``Original Data'', to \mr. Using \mr~to perform analyses and create visualisations requires the call of
a single function call per-technique; the functions are {\texttt{create\_random\_sampling\_graphs()}} and
{\texttt{create\_operator\_sampling\_graphs()}}. Both functions accumulate the reduced data over 30 trials into a single
data set, as shown by the ``Accumulated Reduced Data'' ellipse in Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}.  After performing a
reduction technique, it is evaluated in the ``Efficiency and Effectiveness Analysis'' phase that results in the output
of these values: mutation score (MS), cost reduction (Red.), correlation (Corr.), and error (Err.).

% Quickly explain the three outputs of the next function

While mutation score and cost reduction are calculated in the function performing the analysis, a correlation
coefficient and two error metrics are calculated by \texttt{analyse\_calculations()}, where the function's input is the
accumulated data from a reduction technique and the output is a new data set with these three effectiveness
values.

% Explain the correlation details
% Explain the error details

The \mr~tool employs correlation to determine how the mutation score arising from the reduced set of mutants corresponds
to the score produced by the full mutant set. Kendall's \taub~is a measure of correlation between -1 and 1, representing
a strong negative and strong positive association, respectively, with 0 indicating that there is no
correlation~\cite{mcleod2015kendall}. Following Inozemtseva and Holmes, we adopt the Guildford scale to describe a
correlation, with the absolute value of a coefficient being described as ``low'' when it is less than $0.4$,
``moderate'' when it is between $0.4$ and $0.7$, ``high'' between $0.7$ to $0.9$, and ``very high'' when it is greater
than $0.9$~\cite{inozemtseva2014coverage}. The errors calculated by \mr~are the widely-used root mean square error
(RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)~\cite{chai2014root}, both ``lower-is-better'' metrics showing the difference
between the mutation scores for the reduced and full set of mutants.

% GMK NOTE: I cut all of this content because it was either too detailed or not absolutely needed

% Due to the possibility of rank ties, which are not supported by a number of correlation measures, \mr~uses the tie-aware
% Kendall's \taub~coefficient, as provided by the ``Kendall'' R package \cite{KendallCran}.

% Demonstrating the usability of \mr~is the fact that it requires only two commands to
% perform the analysis and calculate model evaluation. This same simplicity also remains true for the final phase, ``Human
% Examination''.

% These error metrics were chosen due to their wide adoption to evaluate model performance~\cite{chai2014root}.

% Explain what happens with these visualisations and how they were produced

In the human examination phase of Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}, \mr~presents the results of the efficiency and
effectiveness analysis by using Wickham's graphing package, \texttt{ggplot2}~\cite{ggplot2}, to create comprehensible
visualisations, that help a user to construct a policy recommendation regarding which reduction technique should be
incorporated into a mutation testing tool. Examples of the documentation, a screencast~\cite{asciinema}, and these
visualisations can be found on \mr's GitHub page~\cite{tool}.
