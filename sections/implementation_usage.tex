\subsection{Tool Usage}

\input{figures/mrstudyr}

Release as an R package makes installing and loading a tool easy, but does not guarantee usability.
\mr~was designed to be simple, yet perform stringent empirical analyses on mutant reduction techniques.
To display the results from \mr~performing mutant reduction strategies for the testing of real-world
database schemas, the following commands will be tailored toward the data from performing mutation
testing.

The common structure of an R package is to have externally-collected data in the \texttt{inst/extdata}
folder. This is the location where~\mr expects to find the collect mutation data, stored as a
comma-separated value file.

``Reduction Techniques'', as referred to in Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}, are performed following the
provision of mutant data collected from mutation testing on all mutants --- the ``Original Data'' ---
to \mr. Using \mr~to perform analyses and create visualisations is a single command per-technique.
For random and across-operator sampling, the commands are {\texttt{create\_random\_sampling\_graphs()}}
and {\texttt{create\_operator\_sampling\_graphs()}}, respectively. Both functions accumulate the analysed
reduced data over 30 trials into a single data set, as shown by the ``Accumulated Reduced Data'' ellipse
in Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}. After performing a reduction technique, it is evaluated in ``Efficiency and
Effectiveness Analysis''. The evaluation calculations in efficiency and effectiveness analysis, and their
respective abbreviations, are as follows: mutation score (MS), cost reduction (Red.), correlation (Corr.),
and error (Err.).

% Due to space constraints, did not discuss the difference between RMSE and MAE.

While mutation score and cost reduction are calculated in the function performing the analysis, Kendall's
\taub~correlation coefficient~\cite{mcminn2016virtual} and the chosen errors are calculated by
\texttt{analyse\_calculations()}, where the input is the accumulated reduced data from a reduction technique
and the output is a new data set with the values of the respective calculation.  The errors calculated by
\mr~are the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE).  These error calculations were
chosen due to their wide adoption to evaluate model performance~\cite{chai2014root}. Performing the analysis
and calculating these model evaluation metrics demonstrates the simplicity of \mr~ by requiring only two
commands. This same theme is continued to the final phase, ``Human Examination''.

The human examination phase still requires use of \mr~to present the results of the efficiency and
effectiveness analysis. \mr~takes advantage of Hadley Wickham's widely-used graphing package,
\texttt{ggplot2}~\cite{ggplot2}, to create comprehensible visualisations, which will help researchers and
industrialists construct a policy recommendation regarding which reduction technique should be used for the
data under observation. The documentation, a screencast~\cite{asciinema}, and useful visualisations can be
found on \mr's GitHub page~\cite{tool}.
