% CJM: I think we should move 'data' to the same line as the function call

Release as an R package makes installing and loading a tool easy, but does not guarantee usability.
\mr~was designed to be simplistic, yet perform stringent empirical analyses on mutant reduction techniques. To
display the results from \mr~analysing mutant reduction strategies for the testing of real-world database schemas,
the following commands will be tailored toward the data from performing mutation testing. The collected data can
be read in via the following: {\small\texttt{data <- read\_data("sqlite-avmdefaults.dat")}}. This
function expects the data to be located in the \texttt{inst/extdata} folder and stored as a
comma-separated value file.

% CJM: I noticed in section 2.C (Conducting Experiment Campaigns) that it already explains that mrstudyr
% focuses on mutant sampling. Therefore, I am going to remove the sentences in this section restating
% this fact. These sentences are commented-out immediately follow this comment.

% Currently, the two most common sub-techniques of mutant sampling are performed using the following:
% \texttt{analyse\_random\_sampling(data)} and \texttt{analyse\_across\_operators(data)},
% for random sampling and sampling across operators, respectively.

% CJM: Additionally, the attributes of the data that I describe are specific to mutant sampling. I will
% remove these attributes.

% CJM: Is including the following statement entirely necessary? I removed it for now.

% Sample output from the \texttt{analyse} function is provided in the accompanying README file on the
% tool's GitHub page~\cite{tool}.

% This data includes the trial, total number of mutants analysed, number of killed mutants, mutant set generation time
% and the mutation scores for the reduced and original sets. After performing the reduction techniques,

``Reduction Techniques'', as referred to in Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}, are performed following the provision
of mutant data collected from mutation testing on all mutants --- the ``Original Data'' --- to \mr. Using
\mr~to perform reduction techniques is a single command: \texttt{analyse(data)}. Each reduction technique performed by
the \texttt{analyse} function returns reduced data which is then cumulated into a single data set, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}. After performing a reduction technique, it is evaluated in ``Efficiency and Effectiveness
Analysis'', displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:mrstudyr}.
% CJM: I want to present the evaluation metrics of efficiency and effectiveness, then define them, then finally,
% how to perform them with mrstudyr.
The evaluation calculations in efficiency and effectiveness analysis --- and their respective abreviations --- are: mutation score
(MS), creation cost reduction (Red.), correlation (Corr.), and error (Err.).

% Cut due to space constraints
% The mutation score of a set is calculated
% by dividing the number of killed mutants by the total number of mutants~\cite{wong1995reducing}. The reduction
% in creation cost for a set of mutants is the cost of the reduced set subtracted from the cost of the original set,
% divided by the cost of the original set. The original and reduced sets' mutation score correlation is calculated
% using Kendall's~\taub, supported by the ``Kendall'' R package~\cite{mcleod2015kendall}. Finally, the error --- both
% MAE and RMSE --- between the original and reduced sets' mutation score is calculated using the existing ``Metrics''
% R package~\cite{metrics}.

The aforementioned metrics, with the exception of correlation, are calculated by a single function in \mr~:
\texttt{analyse\_calculations(data)}, where the input is the cumulated reduced data and the output is a data set with the
values of the respective calculation. To calculate correlation between reduced and original mutation scores, the
\texttt{analyse\_correlation(data)} function is used, where the input to this function, is again, the cumulated reduced data
and the output is a data set containing only Kendall's \taub~correlation coefficient. The simplicity and usability of \mr~is
upheld by requiring only the use of two commands to analyse the efficiency and effective of reduction techniques. This same
simplicity is continued in the ``Human Examination'' phase.

% CJM: removed this paragraph because I no longer think that it is needed and to save space for preliminary study
% Additionally, the \texttt{analyse\_calculations} function can be used to calculate the
% efficiency and effectiveness for any number of reduction approaches; it is not structurally
% limited to a single reduction method. As input, the \texttt{analyse\_calculations} function
% expects the dataframe returned from performing a reduction approach.

The human examination phase still requires use of \mr~for visualising the trends in the data collected from efficiency and effectiveness
analysis. The \mr~tool takes advantage of Hadley Wickham's widely-used graphing package, \texttt{ggplot2}~\cite{ggplot2}. The
visualisation functions provided by \mr~can be found on \mr's GitHub page~\cite{tool}. These visualisations will help human examiners
to construct a policy recommendation regarding which reduction technique should be used for the specific domain and data under observation.
