\section{\textit{mrstudyr}: Mutant Reduction Studier}

Performing the entire mutation analysis process, displayed in Figure \ref{fig:process},
is both computationally expensive and time consuming. The mutation testing
phase, displayed in Figure \ref{fig:process}, of the mutation analysis
process consists of generating and executing mutated versions of source code. The primary
expense of the mutation analysis process is incurred in the mutation testing phase
due to the large number of generated mutants---even for programs with few lines of code \cite{offutt2001mutation}.
