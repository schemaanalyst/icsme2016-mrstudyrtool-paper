% Performing mutation testing, displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:process}, is often considered to be too expensive to take

% Review the process of mutation testing, starting with the first part at the top of the diagram

When performed with tools such as Major~\cite{Just2011b}, the process of mutation testing, as displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:process}, involves the use of operators to generate mutants for a specific program and then the
execution of tests to determine how they kill the mutants. The outcome of this phase is the higher-is-better mutation
score, or the ratio of the number of killed mutants to the number of mutants generated~\cite{Just2011a}. In many cases,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:process}, it is necessary to perform various analyses of the mutants. For instance, testers
may want to see which mutants were not killed so as to determine if they are equivalent (i.e., semantically the same as
the original program) or, alternatively, prompts for ways to improve the test suite.

% Start to discuss the idea of retrospective mutant analysis for reduction techniques (questions you can answer)

This paper presents another type of mutant analysis: the retrospective study of mutant reduction techniques. Leveraging
data collected during mutation testing (e.g., the name of an operator that produced a mutant, the kill-status of a
mutant, and the costs of producing and analysing a mutant), this method supports the study of mutant reduction
techniques. This type of analysis allows testers to ask and answer questions like ``what would the mutation score be if
only a random 20\% of the mutants were executed?'' While questions of this nature could be executed through, for
instance, either a manual analysis or a bespoke program, this paper presents \mr, a tool that makes it easy to
effectively pose and answer questions about methods for mutant reduction.

% The first of its kind, \mr~is a tool for performing the retrospective analysis of mutant reduction techniques. Upon
% collecting generalised data from performing mutation testing on all mutants, \mr~is capable of determining efficiency
% and effectiveness of well-known mutant reduction techniques specific to the data.

By accepting a generalised input format, the \mr~tool can be utilised in a variety of domains to assess the efficiency
and effectiveness of mutant reduction techniques.  In this paper, we display that \mr~is versatile by conducting a
preliminary study of mutant reduction techniques on mutant data collected from testing database schemas.  However, the
\mr~tool is not limited to analysing mutant data from programs or databases, it can effectively be used in any number
domains. Where mutation testing can be performed, \mr~is capable of analysing reduction techniques.

The \mr~tool is not limited to the domains where it can be utilized, nor is it restricted
by the reduction approaches it can perform. In the current state, \mr~is able to perform
the most common mutant reduction technique, mutant sampling~\cite{gopinath2015mutation, jia2011analysis, gopinath2015empirical}.
The \mr~tool can be extended to perform specific reduction techniques such as E-Selective
~\cite{offutt1996experimental} --- where only mutants created by the following Mothra operators
are chosen: ABS, UOI, LCR, AOR and ROR~\cite{gopinath2015empirical} or complex reduction techniques
such as mutant clustering, where mutants are chosen based on clustering algorithms~\cite{jia2011analysis}.

In addition to being extensible in both the domains in which it can be utilized and the
reduction approaches it can perform, \mr~is accompanied with extensive documentation~\cite{tool}.
The documentation includes the necessary commands to get the reader ``up-and-running''
with \mr~quickly and obviates the need to read a poorly-formatted command-line manual page.
The various accepted function calls of the \mr~tool are also provided in the documentation
accompanied by their respective output. Finally, provided in the documentation is a live
asciinema~\cite{asciinema} screencast, displaying usage of the tool.

The \mr~tool has been released on the popular Git repository hosting service, GitHub~\cite{github}
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License~\cite{license}. The GNU General Public License
allows for commercial, patent and private use, as well as distribution of and modification to the tool
under the condition that anything derived from it is bound by the same conditions as the originally
released version~\cite{copyleft}.
