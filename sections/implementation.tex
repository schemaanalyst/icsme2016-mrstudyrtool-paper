\section{Implementation}

The R programming language for statistical data analysis was specifically designed to
be a full statistical language for conducting empirical studies. Following its predecessor,
R is a powerful means for data analysts to express computations~\cite{ihaka1996r}.
In R, the fundamental way to share code is via a package.

R packages are easy to distribute and include code, data, documentation and tests~\cite{wickham2015r}.
Since \mr has been released as an R package, installing the tool requires 
four commands in the R console.
First, \texttt{install.packages("devtools")}, then {\small\texttt{library(devtools)}}
to install and load the {\small\texttt{devtools}}~\cite{devtools} package, respectively.
The \texttt{devtools} package is necessary because it provides functions for installing
and maintaining \mr as well as its dependencies. Finally, to install
\mr~\cite{tool} from the popular Git repository hosting service, GitHub~\cite{github},
use the following command: {\small\texttt{devtools::install\_github("mccurdyc/mrstudyr")}}.
Then, finally, load \mr using \texttt{library(mrstudyr)}.
