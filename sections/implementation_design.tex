\subsection{Tool Design}

The \mr tool was designed for empirically studying the effects of various $x\%$ for
the two aforementioned reduction techniques in Mutant Sampling and Uniform Sampling Over Mutation Operators.
Where Wong and Mathur in their studies \cite{mathur1994empirical}, \cite{wong1993mutation} conducted
an experiment using random sampling with $x$ from $10\%$ to $40\%$ increasing by steps of $5\%$, we
chose to start $x$ at $10\%$ and increase by intervals $10\%$ up to $90\%$. By increasing by $10\%$ intervals instead of
by $1\%$ or $5\%$, we are able to reduce the cost of performing the retrospective analysis.

While reducing the costs of performing the retrospective analysis were a primary concern, it does not
outweigh producing accurate results. Although we conducted our experiments with $x$ increasing by
$10\%$ intervals, we did not see a significant enough loss in accuracy and in the amount of data collected to make
it worth running the additional trials for with the smaller intervals (i.e. $1\%$ or $5\%$).

When it came to determining the number of trials necessary for each configuration, we followed
the recommendations of Traeger et al. and Arcuri, by running 30 trials \cite{traeger2008nine, arcuri2014hitchhiker}.
The general rule in many fields of science is to at least perform 30 observations to show with high confidence
that the obtained results are statistically significant and to allow for the results to approximate a normal
distribution.
