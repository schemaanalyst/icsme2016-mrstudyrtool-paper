% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's

%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
 \usepackage{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

    A well known method for measuring test suite or database schema quality is mutation analysis.
    Due to the computational expense of mutation analysis, it is
    rarely used to determine the quality of products in industry. One
    of the trivial approaches for reducing the computational expense of
    mutation analysis is by reducing the number of mutations being analyzed.
    This is known as a do \textit{fewer} or selective approach. I analyze the effectiveness
    of a tool in \textit{selectms} at performing two existing selective approaches for
    performing mutation analysis.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Mutation Testing}

Mutation testing is a well-known approach for determining the quality of test
suites \cite{gopinath2015empirical}. Additionally, as McMinn et al. discovered, the quality of a database schema
can be determined through the use of mutation testing \cite{mcminn2015effectiveness}. In
this paper, I am using mutant data from performing mutation analysis on 34 well-known database schemas.

Testing mutations---modified versions of source code containing faults---which is now
referred to as mutation testing, was originally proposed by Richard A. DeMillo et al.
in the 1970's \cite{demillo1978hints}. Each modified version of a program or schema contains
exactly one fault. The goal is to have each modified, or faulty, version of the source code
fail when executed against the tests \cite{offutt1993experimental}. If a test fails that was expected to fail
for the given input, then the fault has been exploited and the mutation, also referred to as a mutant,
was \textit{killed}. A mutant that has been killed is considered to be \textit{dead} and no
longer needs to remain in the testing process since the faults represented by this type of
mutant are confirmed as being detectable by the test suite \cite{offutt1993experimental}.
Conversely, if a test passes, then the fault was not exploited and is considered to remain
\textit{alive} \cite{mcminnvirtual}.

After constructing all of the mutants for a given program, the user then adds the test cases
to a mutation testing system such as \texttt{MAJOR} \cite{just2011major} or
\texttt{Defects4J} \cite{just2014defects4j}. After adding the tests to a mutation testing system,
the user then needs to ensure that the output is correct. If the output is incorrect, then
a fault has been exploited and the mutant is considered to be killed \cite{offutt1993experimental}.
After all test cases have been executed against all of the live mutants, remaining mutants are either
considered to be \textit{equivalent} or the test cases are insufficient to kill that type of mutant \cite{gopinath2015empirical}. An equivalent
mutant always produces the same output as the original program, making it undetectable by any test. A mutant
is a \textit{normal} mutant if it is not equivalent.
Finally, a score, referred to as the mutation score for the test data can be calculated.

\subsection{Calculating Mutation Score}
Mutation score, displayed in Equation \ref{eq:ms}, is the ratio of killed \textit{normal} faults, denoted $k$ to the total number of \textit{normal} faults \cite{wright2013efficient}.
The total number of normal mutants can be calculated by summing the number of normal mutants that are both killed and alive, denoted $k$ and $a$, repectively.
Equivalent mutants are excluded because, by definition, they cannot be detected by a unit test \cite{inozemtseva2014coverage}.

\begin{equation}
    Mutation \, Score(k,a) = \frac{k}{k+a}
    \label{eq:ms}
\end{equation}

Test data with a 100\% mutation score is said to be \textit{mutation adequate} \cite{offutt1993experimental}.
Mutation adequacy can mean one of two things, the better of the two being the test suite
or database schema is of high quality. Second, the introduced faults are very easily
discovered and are not stringent testers of the test suite or schema.

\subsection{The Cost of Mutation Testing}
As previously noted, mutation testing is not able
to be used in practice due to its computational expense.
The primary computational cost is incurred from running the mutated versions
of the source code or database schema against the test cases or integrity
constraints \cite{offutt1993experimental}. Due to the fact that each generated
mutant needs to be run against at least one, possibly many, test cases, mutation
testing requires a large number of computations \cite{offutt1993experimental}.
There has been a substantial amount of work to find a reduced approach
for performing mutation testing \cite{gopinath2015empirical, mcminnvirtual, gopinath2015mutation, offutt1993experimental}.
Offut and Untch categorize the existing mutation testing reduction approaches
into three categories: do \textit{fewer}, do \textit{smarter} and do \textit{faster} \cite{offutt1993experimental}.
In this paper, we are only focused on the do fewer categorization,
specifically, selective mutation testing.

\subsection{Selective Mutation Testing}
Mathur suggests an approach to reducing the cost of performing mutation testing by
reducing the modified or mutant versions of the source code \cite{mathur1991performance}.
Gopinath et al. discuss two existing approaches for performing selective
mutation analysis \cite{gopinath2015mutation}. The two strategies are
sampling criteria and operator selection. Sampling criteria is where I am
currently focused, specifically on unified random sampling and stratified
random sampling over mutation operators \cite{gopinath2015mutation}.

Uniform random sampling is the simplest of the sampling approaches, proposed by Timothy A. Budd,
where an arbitrary fraction of the full set of mutants is chosen \cite{budd1980mutation}.
Zhang et al. analyzed the performance of uniform random sampling as a reduction technique
and found that sampling as few as 5\% of mutants can be very highly correlated with the full mutation
score \cite{zhang2010operator, zhang2013operator}.

Wong et al. first suggested sampling the same number of mutants from each operator, known as
stratified random sampling over mutation operators \cite{wong1995reducing}. It is similar
to uniform random sampling in the way that the same arbitrary fraction is applied. However,
instead of applying the fraction over all mutants for a schema, the fraction is applied for all operators. In other
words, the reduced set contains all possible operators, but only a fraction of the mutants
with that operator. Stratified random sampling over mutation operators is subtly different
from uniform random sampling because each operator is still present in the reduced set, where
in uniform random sampling this is not considered.

At this point, these are the only reduction strategies present in my research and available for analyzing
with my tool, as time goes on and I implement more approaches, I will discuss them in further detail.

\section{Method of Approach}
For analyzing the existing selective approaches discussed previously, I have created
a tool, \texttt{selectms}. This tool reads in data, expecting the data to contain
specific attributes: identifier, dbms, schema, operator, type, killed, time. The identifier attribute
is a universally unique set of characters describing the combination of database management system (dmbs)
and schema. The dbms attribute is as the name suggests, a character value representing the database management system under observation.
The schema and operator attributes, both character values, are the schema and operator under observation. The type attribute, a set of characters,
refers to the type of mutant: equivalent, stillborn or normal. However, as previously mentioned, we filter out all non-normal mutants.
A boolean value, killed, is either true or false, if the mutant is dead or alive, respectively. Finally, the time attribute is an
integer value representing the time it takes---in milliseconds---to create the mutant.

As previously mentioned, I am comparing uniform random sampling and stratified random sampling.
The fractional values that I analyzed for both of the selective approaches are:
$\{\frac{1}{100}, \frac{10}{100}, \frac{20}{100}, \frac{30}{100}, \frac{40}{100}, \frac{50}{100}, \frac{60}{100}, \frac{70}{100}, \frac{80}{100}, \frac{90}{100}\}$.
I chose to increase by 10\% rather than analyzing each percentage due to the computation expense of the analysis if performed for each percentage.

I ran each possible configuration of fractional value for uniform random sampling and stratified random sampling
for 30 trials as suggested by Traeger and Zadok to allow for a normal distribution \cite{traeger2008nine}. Additionally,
I kept the fractional values and number of trials for each configuration of sampling approach consistent throughout
my analysis.

\end{figure*}

\section{Analysis of Results}
The data analyzed in this paper was generated from performing mutation testing on
34 database schemas using the SQLite database management system. The data
contain 118860 mutants, which as a whole, take 67287543 milliseconds to analyze using mutation analysis.

Reducing this cost is the primary focus. However, reducing cost by analyzing fewer mutants
leads to less correlated mutation scores and higher mean absolute and root mean squared errors (displayed
in Figures \ref{fig:comp_corr} and \ref{fig:comp_error}, respectively). In this paper, I will
analyze the graphs comparing mutation score, error and correlation (on the y-axis) to percentage (on the x-axis),
specifically for the Inventory schema.

As previously mentioned, the mutation score associated with a test suite or database schema is a value
corresponding to the quality of the test suite or schema. By reducing the mutant set by fractional values,
we are able to receive mutation scores that are very close to the original mutation score (e.g., both uniform random sampling
and stratified random sampling over operators on only $30\%$ of the original mutants produce mutation scores ranging between 0.70 and 0.80, where the
original mutation score is 0.75). As displayed
in Figure \ref{fig:comp} and previously noted by Budd et al. in \cite{budd1980mutation}, even as small
as $10\%$ of the original set can produce mutation scores that are considered to be highly correlated
($\tau_b \approx 0.73$ for uniform random sampling and $\tau_b \approx 0.76$ for stratified random sampling over operators).
The correlation between the mutation scores of both reduced sets from both approaches and the original set for all fractional values---using Kendall's $\tau_b$---can
observed in Figure \ref{fig:comp_corr}.

Inozemtseva and Holmes adopt the Guildford scale to described correlation values. I will similarly
describe correlations between sets' mutation score using the same Guildford scale.
The Guildford scale describes the absolute value of a coefficient as ``low'' when it is less than 0.4,
``moderate'' when it is between 0.4 and 0.7, ``high'' when ranging from 0.7 to 0.9, and ``very high''
when it is greater than 0.9 \cite{inozemtseva2014coverage}.

Finally, when observing mean absolute and root mean squared errors displayed in Figure \ref{fig:comp_error},
I noticed that both approaches experience a similar decrease in error as the reduced sets
get larger---increase in fractional value. When analyzing the errors experienced for sets between
$1 - 30\%$ of the original mutant set, both uniform random sampling and stratified random sampling over mutation operators
encounter a rapid decrease in error, or increase in accuracy.

After performing selective mutation analysis I have observed that all reduced sets from both
uniform random sampling and stratified random sampling over mutation operators produce sets with mutation scores that are
considered to be ``highly'' correlated, with the only exception
being the reduced set produced by random sampling with $1\%$, which produces a reduced set with a mutation score that is considered
to be weakly correlated to that of the mutation score of the entire set of mutations.

Although we are able to produce
reduced sets with highly correlated mutation scores, we are not able to produced sets with
very highly correlated mutation scores using either of the selective approaches begin analyzed.

I chose only to provide the visualizations for the Inventory schema because it effectively displays
the consequences that selective mutation analysis can have on the mutation score. Additionally,
there are nine schemas that are mutation adequate, meaning that no matter how small the test data
are, data for the corresponding schema will \textit{always} produce mutation adequate sets. This is what I consider
to be an ineffective display of the cause of selective mutation analysis.

% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
